## Finance Stock Project Backend 
Created for a stock market website. Created by React. There is three main page, first page is home. In Home page, Listed all stocks with real time values, user can add some stock that wanted to buy to basket. Second page is basket, user can see total price of wanted to buy stocks and can buy here (There is no payment system, it is guess). Third page is profile page, user can check owned stocks and can sell them. Also user can check transaction history.
